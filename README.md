# StormSurge
This is the game I made for js13kGames.  Storm Surge is about keeping a thunderstorm from interrupting your viewing of cat GIFs, memes, and maybe work.

# Goal
Don't let the lightning strike within the fence of your home.
Use your fire cannon to evaporate the clouds so they can't strike.

# Controls
A or left arrow - Move cannon left  
D or right arrow - Move cannon right  
Space - Shoot cannon
